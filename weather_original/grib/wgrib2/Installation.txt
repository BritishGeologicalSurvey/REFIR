                 Wgrib2 for Windows    8/2006 revised 7/2017

This is a version of wgrib2 for windows.  It is compiled from the original 
wgrib2 source code using the cygwin_64 system.  Wgrib2 has been compiled
on Windows using other compilers such as Intel and MingGW. However Cygwin's
compilers are recommended because it supports files greater than 2GB
without adding Windows-only C functions.

One should compile wgrib2 from the latest source code.  However, some people
have difficulting compiling, so some executables have been made.  The
main disadvantage of using precompiled code is that it may be much older
than the current version.  

I compiled the source codes on on a Windows 10 box using the cygwin system.
It seems to work BUT my testing has been very limited.  I don't routinely 
run this code under Windows, so think of yourself as a beta tester.  

Installation:

  Non-Cygwin sytem:

     Version 1:
	Copy the *.dll and wgrib2.exe files to a directory on your $path. 
        Then you can use wgrib2 without giving the directory name.

     Version 1:
	Copy the *.dll and wgrib2.exe files to a directory.
        Then you can run wgrib2 by giving full name of wgrib2.


  Cygwin system:

	copy wgrib2.exe files to a directory on your $PATH.
        Try running wgrib2.  If your .dll files are too old/new,
          download it from your favorite cygwin mirror site.  If the .dll
          you will need to recompile wgrib2.  I used the stock makefile
          to compile wgrib2.


Compilation instructions under Cygwin.

    Same compiling steps as in linux using gcc/gfortran.
