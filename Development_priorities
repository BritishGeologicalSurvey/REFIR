- Implement the weather package. This means:
	* When the user runs FIX, after the selection of the volcano location, we need to give the user the possibility to choose whether to use manually entered weather parameters or automatically retrieved ones. In the latter case, the panel shown in Fig. 16 of the manual has to be changed, specifically we need to remove all the entries below "atmospheric conditions" with something like:
		+ "Automatically retrieved by GFS 0.25degree" if in forecast mode
		or
		+ "Automatically retrieved by ECMWF ERAInterim" if in reanalysis mode
	* Modify FoxScreen to display the vertical profiles of weather conditions (T and wind)
DONE

- Modify the format for reading radar data from Iceland (see, e.g., http://brunnur.vedur.is/radar/vespa/hekla/eht_hekla_2018-07-13.txt). This has been changed from when REFIR was first developed. 
DONE

- Implement the possibility to run in reanalysis mode. As it is now, REFIR runs in realtime, but it is possible to simulate the datastream (see folder simulated_data_stream). I want this to be better organized, as an option that the user can choose from the beginning. This will in turn activate the reanalysis mode for the weather data retrieval.

- When starting FIX, the user can choose between different Icelandic volcano as the eruption location (see fig. 13, which bases on the volcano_list.ini). This file can be generated with FoxSet.py in refir_config, either using the defaul Iceland configuration or manually adding new volcano. I want this to change radically, by using the official smithsonian Institute list of volcanoes (see volcanoExport file in REFIR), since this list as unique IDs. The generation of Cband.ini, Xband.ini and Cam.ini has to be made manually by the user, since it will be observatory-specific

- Include Woodhouse et al. (2013) model (eq. 30 of the paper stored in docs). This will mean:
	* add new entry in "Set model parameters" menu (model wt factors).
	* add new Wt factor in the code
	* modifies all the formulas for assessing the best estimates of the plume height accordingly
	* include the model equation in FOXI
	* Modify FoxScreen, in particular plot "Mass Eruption Rate" (D in fig. 61) to display a new line for this model
DONE

- Correct function manMER_import, which causes FOXI to crash when two manually input MER values are stored in the file fix_MERin.txt.
  UPDATE: it seems that FOXI works only with manual MER data in the file (and probably the same happens with the
  "experimental MER". To fix this, it will take long. So I will probably make FOXI read only the most up to date datum (first line of 
fix_MERin.txt
