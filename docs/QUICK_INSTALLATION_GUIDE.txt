QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR REFIR
==================================

1. Extract the zip file "REFIR.zip" to a working folder of your choice.

2. After successful extraction, the working folder should contain:
 - the program FIX.py
 - the program FOXI.py
 - the program FoxScreen.py
 - and a subfolder named "refir_config", which contains the program "FoxSet.py" and the default "*,ini" files for the "FutureVolc" setup. 

3. If you want to apply REFIR in another configuration than the default "FutureVolc" setup, just delete all *.ini" files and run "FoxSet.py" for generating new ones.   

4. REFIR is now successfully set up.


QUICK GUIDE FOR INITIALIZING REFIR
===================================

1. When the "*.ini" files have been correctly adjusted, start FIX.py and select the volcano to be monitored.
Remember to close the initial window, to access the main panel of GUI!

2. With FIX.py, select the appropriate settings for REFIR and don't forget to press "confirm" or "update settings" buttons. 

3. If you want to generate a map, click on "Output Control". A window opens which gives you the possibility to specify the output settings. In this window, click on "Show Map".

4. After your initial settings are made, you can start FOXI.py parallelly to FIX.py.
In the initial window specify the time and date of eruption start, and a root name for the output files (e.g. "HEKLA").

4. Click on "Initiate!" and close the initial window. 
FOXI.py starts its first run (and will continue to run automatically every five minutes in the background).

5. To display the output by FOXI.py, start FoxScreen.py.
In the console, specify the root name of the files generated by FOXI (in this example: "HEKLA")

6. A window opens, which gives an operational overview of the current estimates by REFIR.


 
At any time the operator can change the settings via FIX, and the display via FoxScreen.
