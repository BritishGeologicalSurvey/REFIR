With Conda, it is possible to set a virtual environmnent with all the required dependencies specific for REFIR. This simplifies the 
installation of the different packages and the management of the Python installation in the system.
Instructions for setting the Conda environment:
1) create the environment with all the needed additional packages:
	conda create --name name_of_environment python=3.7 basemap pandas xlrd future pillow cdsapi pathos
2) activate the environment with:
	source activate name_of_environment (Linux)
	conda activate name_of_environment (Windows)
3) install ecmwfapi
	pip install --user https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/download/attachments/56664858/ecmwf-api-client-python.tgz
4) to exit from the environment:
	source deactivate (Linux)
	conda deactivate (Windows)
